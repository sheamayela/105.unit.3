This is a repository containing instructional material and sample datasets for Professor Gotzler's section of English 105 at the University of Carolina Chapel Hill.

The repository contains 2 python notebooks covering basic topics and coding with Python 3 and beginner modules on using panda's package for data analysis. 

These materials have been adapted from the excellent lessons created by the staff at the research hub at UNC Davis Library.

     This data is from an excel sheet titled County Health Data from the years 2014 to 2015. It includes public health data from each state in the United States. It also includes statistics for the division, county, and region of each state. The focus of the data on this sheet is to focus on the most prevalent ways people's health in the US has been affected. It also includes a variety of data specific to physical or mental health and adults or children.

    The purpose of this dataset is to focus on the effect of food insecurity on the health of citizens in North Carolina. This is for the general public so they can be aware of the prevalence of certain diseases due to unhealthy diets. It could be for persons with public health careers who want to provide solutions that will enable the betterment of citizens' diets. In general, this data provides information about the correlation between food insecurity and physical health.
 
     Food insecurity is when a household is unable to feed every member of the house. This is due to economic challenges, so families can not afford proper meals. This problem leads families to buy cheaper food which is filled will saturated fats. Saturated fats are unhealthy for the body and can increase the risk of diabetes and obesity. Another factor that this data set supports is when people have limited access to healthy foods. This limit forces people to buy fast foods which are considered cheap meals which leads to health consequences. This data can be used by officals to create a plan such as providing government aid to areas that need it, building more supermarkets in scarce areas, educating people on health food habits while on a budget, and more.
